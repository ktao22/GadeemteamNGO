Since April 2023, many families have fled from Sudan to Egypt seeking peace. Due to the huge number, many students were forced to go illegally to Egypt, need to get refugee status in order to be recognised in the country and can only go to certain schools for refugees in Egypt. A major problem with these schools is that they are overloaded and they cannot take as many refugee students as there are, and many families cannot afford the very few necessities for their children to go to school. 

UWC STEM for Peace is a sustainable education project utilizing technology and science education at UWC to tackle the problem from two sides. We will design and equip a mini STEM lab, to deliver both hardware (a mini science lab, HopEd, a self-paced learning app based on relevant local curriculums of the students we will serve) and software (on-site and online teachers outsourced from UWC Changshu science students) to African Hope Learning Centre.

## Karen Tao

I would love to give back to UWC through this project. I am immensely grateful for the opportunities at UWC that opened me to so many different perspectives. By chance, meeting Mohamed, sharing our very different stories and collaborating on different projects together in the Peace Council sparked our idea of combining both of our interests to educate for peace. 

The language barrier is a challenge. However, I recently began my journey learning Arabic. This is more of an opportunity than a challenge to immerse in a totally different culture. Personally, UWC STEM for Peace would be a huge life-changing initiative to carry out in a totally new country, and lead to many meaningful experiences.

April 2023 marked a sudden turning point in my life and many Sudanese people as war broke out in Sudan. As chaos started escalating in Khartoum we were forced to leave our house, and I watched the Rapid Support Forces militia looting all of our assets. To continue my educational journey, I traveled to Egypt leaving my parents behind and sat for Cambridge IGCSE exams in Egypt. While there was struggle and chaos, I challenged myself and I completed eight subjects and came in with seven A*s and one A. Since then, I have been driven by the desire to ensure that others do not face the same obstacles I once encountered.

Going back 2020 during COVID time, I helped founding Gadeemteam with my two brothers. Volunteering with Gadeemteam has contributing greatly to my personal growth, especially after the war erupted in Sudan. Aligning with Gadeemteam’s mission, make high-quality education accessible and affordable (SDG 4), I provided 34 hours free lessons, 52 hours low-cost lessons, built a Drive for resources for 11 subjects and created a WhatsApp group with 400+ members after I received my results in January 2024.

The UWC STEM for Peace project was born out of a desire to use the STEM knowledge I have learned at UWC Changshu to real-life challenges. I am deeply passionate about this initiative because it embodies UWC’s mission, promoting education and peace, even in the face of the struggles of being a refugee. Through this project, I hope to give back to UWC by advancing its mission in a tangible way and empowering marginalized students through education.
## Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics

### Verifiability

Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of financial information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity.

### Comparability

Comparability is the uniform application of accounting methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application of accounting across points in time within an entity.

### Understandability

Understandability means that accounting reports should be expressed as clearly as possible and should be understood by those to whom the information is relevant.
Timeliness: Timeliness implies that financial information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made.

## Statement of cash flows

The statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows: Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance

| Cash Inflow | Outflow   | Opening Balance |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| _Monday_    | `Tuesday` | **Wednesday**   |
| 1           | 2         | 3               |

**Example 1:** in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen's cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:

- Cash inflow: $20
- Cash outflow:$7
- Opening balance: $5
- Closing balance: $20 – $7 + $5 = $18

**Example 2:** in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:

> **Important:** the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.

## Statement of financial position (balance sheet)

The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm's assets, liabilities and equity (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement.

- **fixed assets**
  - property
  - building
  - equipment (such as factory machinery)
- **intangible assets**
  - copyrights
  - trademarks
  - patents
    - pending
    - international
- goodwill

Owner's equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.
